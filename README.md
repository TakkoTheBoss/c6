# C6: Cyberphysical System Integrations & Interoperability Communications Security

C6 is a discipline, a framework, and a movement focused on securing the conduits that connect cyber-physical systems (CPS). In critical infrastructure and emerging technologies, our safety depends not just on devices or endpoints but on the trustworthiness of the pathways that link them together.

## What is C6?

- **Discipline:** Establishes conduit security as a recognized field of study within cybersecurity.  
- **Framework:** Provides practical methodologies, including the SAIC model (Safety, Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality) and Conduit Security Profiles (CSPs).  
- **Movement:** Promotes a safety-first mindset across engineering, operations, policy, and public awareness.  

## Why C6?

Traditional cybersecurity focuses on the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). While essential, this model is centered on protecting data. C6 reframes security through the SAIC tetrad:

- **Safety:** Preventing harm to people and the environment.  
- **Availability:** Ensuring systems continue to function when needed.  
- **Integrity:** Guaranteeing trust in commands and data.  
- **Confidentiality:** Protecting sensitive information.  

By applying SAIC to conduits, C6 highlights risks that often go unnoticed, such as rogue cells, broadcast manipulation, cross-domain gateway abuse, and supply chain weaknesses.

## Scope

C6 defines and analyzes four primary classes of conduits:  
- **Physical:** The actual media that carry signals (fiber, RF, serial).  
- **Logical:** Abstracted communication pathways (VPNs, VLANs, network slices).  
- **Broadcast:** One-to-many open channels (LTE SIBs, GPS, Wi-Fi beacons).  
- **Cross-Domain:** Connections across trust boundaries (IT/OT gateways, cloud APIs, V2X).  

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into versioned folders.  
- **v1.0 (2022):** Original release, sector-focused framing.  
- **v2.0 (2025):** Major revision, conduit-centric, SAIC integrated, formal methodology and CSPs.  
- **future:** Planned expansions with additional conduit profiles, case studies, and tooling.  

## How to Use

- Read the current version in its folder for the most up-to-date specification.  
- Explore example **Conduit Security Profiles (CSPs)** in the appendices.  
- Use C6 as a reference for research, engineering, and policy development.  

## Contributing

C6 is intended as a living body of work. Contributions are welcome:
